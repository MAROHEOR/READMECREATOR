### Instalation 

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

* Make sure you install `npm i inquirer` as shown in the video. 

#### Usage 

Use this application to save time creating your README files. Even when applications want to make your life easier, this application will not avoid you to type the information that you want to present, just the formating part of the work.
